# std::swap_element-

 Swap two elements in a container by their indices.
 
 To use this just add the "swap_element.h" file in you project and include the "swap_element.h" in the file you want to use this Swap Function.
 You can swap any two element in any container of same data type.

# std::custom_pattern_match-

C++ STL algorithm for pattern matching across a variety of container types, such as arrays, vectors, lists, and maps. The custom_pattern_match algorithm allows you to search for a specified pattern within multiple containers using a custom comparison function.

How to use-

1.Include the "pattern_match.h" header in your C++ code.

2.Define your custom comparison lambda function to determine pattern matching logic.

3.Call the custom_pattern_match function with your pattern and container(s) to check for matches.

# std::moving_average - 

The Moving Average Calculation Algorithm computes the moving average of a sequence of numeric values over a specified window size. It takes a sequence of numeric values and a window size as input parameters and outputs a sequence of moving average values corresponding to each position in the input sequence.

Use Case:-

1.Stock Market Analysis: Investors often use moving averages to analyze stock price trends over time. By calculating the moving average of a stock's price over a certain period, investors can identify trends, such as uptrends or downtrends, and make informed trading decisions.

2.Sensor Data Processing: In IoT applications, sensor data is collected continuously. Computing the moving average of sensor readings over time can help detect anomalies or patterns in the data. For example, in environmental monitoring systems, calculating the moving average of temperature readings can help identify long-term trends or sudden fluctuations.

3.Signal Processing: In audio or image processing applications, analyzing the moving average of signals can be useful for noise reduction and signal enhancement. By calculating the moving average of signal samples over a specified window, unwanted noise can be filtered out, improving the quality of the processed data.

To use the Moving Average Calculation Algorithm in your codebase:-

1.Include the necessary headers ("movingaverage.h).

2.Implement the moving_average function, providing it with the input sequence of numeric values, the window size, and an output iterator to store the moving average values.

3.Call the moving_average function with your input sequence and desired window size.

4.Retrieve the computed moving average values from the output iterator and use them for further analysis or visualization.
